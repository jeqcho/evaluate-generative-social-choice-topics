      "deterrence",
      "accountability",
      "clarity",
      "consistency"
    ],
    "Reason": "People litter less when penalties are clear, substantial, and applied predictably by officers who are present and visible in known hotspots."
  },
  "2": {
    "Stance": "Increase the number of bins and improve servicing schedules",
    "Criteria": [
      "convenience",
      "accessibility",
      "maintenance",
      "design"
    ],
    "Reason": "If bins are plentiful, easy to find, and not overflowing, the friction to dispose properly is low, reducing the temptation to litter."

    "Criteria": [
      "awareness",
      "norms",
      "long-term",
      "youth"
    ],
    "Reason": "Teaching why littering harms communities and embedding anti-litter norms early can shift attitudes and create lasting behavior change."

    "Criteria": [
      "nudges",
      "salience",
      "social proof",
      "low-cost"
    ],
    "Reason": "Prominent, well-placed bins, clear signage, footprints or arrows, and messages like 'Most people use the bin' leverage psychology to reduce litter without heavy penalties."

    "Stance": "Support community-led cleanups and stewardship programs",
    "Criteria": [
      "ownership",
      "participation",
      "pride",
      "volunteerism"
    ],
    "Reason": "When residents adopt streets or parks and routinely clean them, it builds pride and social pressure against littering, making clean the community norm."
  },

    "Stance": "Introduce deposits and rewards for returning containers",
    "Criteria": [
      "incentives",
      "circularity",
      "cost-effectiveness",
      "producer-responsibility"
    ],
    "Reason": "Deposit-return schemes and reverse vending machines make littered items financially valuable to return, reducing litter and boosting recycling rates."

    "Criteria": [
      "data-driven",
      "targeting",
      "efficiency",
      "privacy"
    ],
    "Reason": "Sensors, reporting apps, and analytics guide crews to overflowing bins and recurring hotspots, allowing timely collection while balancing privacy in any monitoring."

    "Stance": "Use restorative penalties like cleanup service plus education",
    "Criteria": [
      "rehabilitation",
      "fairness",
      "proportionality",
      "deterrence"
    ],
    "Reason": "Requiring offenders to join cleanup crews and complete brief education can correct behavior, feel fairer than steep fines, and still deter repeat offenses."

    "Criteria": [
      "equity",
      "environmental justice",
      "access",
      "trust"
    ],
    "Reason": "Litter clusters where bins and collection are lacking; investing in sanitation access without over-policing prevents litter while building community trust."

    "Stance": "Tackle sources by limiting single-use items and redesigning packaging",
    "Criteria": [
      "source reduction",
      "regulation",
      "EPR",
      "enforcement"
    ],
    "Reason": "Banning hard-to-manage items and making producers responsible for end-of-life cuts litter upstream, reducing what reaches streets and parks in the first place."
