{
  "1": {
    "Stance": "Strict enforcement and fines",
    "Criteria": [
      "deterrence",
      "accountability",
      "compliance"
    ],
    "Reason": "Visible enforcement, littering citations, and meaningful fines raise the perceived cost of littering and reduce violations, especially in hotspots."
  },
  "2": {
    "Stance": "More and better disposal infrastructure",
    "Criteria": [
      "convenience",
      "accessibility",
      "maintenance"
    ],
    "Reason": "Placing abundant, well-designed bins, ashtrays, and recycling stations where people actually need them\u2014and emptying them frequently\u2014removes friction and prevents overflow that triggers more litter."
  },
  "3": {
    "Stance": "Behavioral nudges and social norms",
    "Criteria": [
      "psychology",
      "salience",
      "norms"
    ],
    "Reason": "Norm-framed signage, playful or sound-making bins, footprints leading to bins, and clean cues make proper disposal salient and socially expected without heavy penalties."
  },
  "4": {
    "Stance": "Education and sustained public campaigns",
    "Criteria": [
      "awareness",
      "culture",
      "long-term"
    ],
    "Reason": "School programs and ongoing media campaigns build shared values and stigma around littering, creating durable habits beyond the reach of enforcement alone."
  },
  "5": {
    "Stance": "Community stewardship and participation",
    "Criteria": [
      "ownership",
      "volunteerism",
      "peer pressure"
    ],
    "Reason": "Adopt-a-park streets, regular cleanups, and citizen reporting foster pride and peer accountability so residents self-police and deter litter in their own areas."
  },
  "6": {
    "Stance": "Deposit-return and producer responsibility",
    "Criteria": [
      "incentives",
      "upstream",
      "circularity"
    ],
    "Reason": "Bottle deposits, take-back schemes, and extended producer responsibility shift costs upstream and reward returns, cutting the amount of packaging that becomes litter."
  },
  "7": {
    "Stance": "Urban design and rapid-clean protocols",
    "Criteria": [
      "design",
      "cleanliness",
      "broken windows"
    ],
    "Reason": "Designing out litter traps (e.g., wind corners), placing butt receptacles where smokers congregate, and fast removal prevent accumulation and the signal that messiness is tolerated."
  },
  "8": {
    "Stance": "Data and technology targeting",
    "Criteria": [
      "analytics",
      "efficiency",
      "monitoring"
    ],
    "Reason": "Smart-bin sensors, litter heat maps, and AI detection guide crews to the right place and time, optimizing limited budgets and focusing on repeat-problem items and locations."
  },
  "9": {
    "Stance": "Equitable, graduated enforcement",
    "Criteria": [
      "fairness",
      "proportionality",
      "trust"
    ],
    "Reason": "Start with warnings and education, use community service in lieu of fines, and ensure bin access so rules don\u2019t disproportionately burden low-income people, which sustains public cooperation."
  },
  "10": {
    "Stance": "Business and event accountability",
    "Criteria": [
      "partnerships",
      "regulation",
      "responsibility"
    ],
    "Reason": "Require venues, food vendors, and events to provide bins, cleanup plans, and refundable bonds, ensuring major litter sources prevent and remove waste generated by their activities."
