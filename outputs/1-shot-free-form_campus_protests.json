{
  "1": {
    "Stance": "Protect robust free speech with content-neutral time, place, and manner rules.",
    "Reason": "Universities are marketplaces of ideas. Administrators should allow demonstrations unless they involve true threats, targeted harassment, or violence, regulating only logistics (e.g., noise limits, building access, hours) in a viewpoint-neutral way to meet legal and educational obligations."
  },
  "2": {
    "Stance": "Safety-first enforcement: prohibit encampments and occupations while providing designated protest areas.",
    "Reason": "Overnight encampments, building takeovers, and blocked entrances raise fire, safety, and accessibility risks. Clear, consistently enforced rules paired with alternative spaces for protest balance expression with physical safety and operational continuity."
  },
  "3": {
    "Stance": "Facilitated dialogue and education alongside protests.",
    "Reason": "Administrators should sponsor teach-ins, structured dialogues, and mediation to channel energy into learning and mutual understanding. This aligns with the academic mission and can reduce polarization and mischaracterization of peers."
  },
  "4": {
    "Stance": "Viewpoint-neutral, transparent decisions with documented criteria and independent review.",
    "Reason": "Publish enforcement standards and incident logs, apply them equally to all sides, and use an oversight committee. Transparency builds trust, reduces claims of bias, and provides legal defensibility."
  },
  "5": {
    "Stance": "Prioritize protection from harassment and discrimination while distinguishing speech from conduct.",
    "Reason": "Administrators should clearly separate protected political speech from prohibited conduct like targeted harassment, doxxing, or vandalism. This protects students vulnerable to antisemitism and Islamophobia without suppressing lawful protest."
  },
  "6": {
    "Stance": "Tolerate nonviolent civil disobedience with proportionate, educational consequences.",
    "Reason": "Issue warnings, use de-escalation, and reserve serious discipline for repeat or dangerous violations. Proportional responses recognize the civic role of protest while maintaining order and due process."
  },
  "7": {
    "Stance": "Limit involvement of non-affiliates and require permits for outside groups.",
    "Reason": "Restricting demonstrations to campus members or permitted guests reduces the risk of escalation by external actors, preserves campus autonomy, and focuses on student expression rather than outside mobilization."
  },
  "8": {
    "Stance": "Protect academic continuity: no disruption of classes, exams, labs, or essential services.",
    "Reason": "Set quiet hours, preserve access routes, and relocate demonstrations when necessary. Ensuring others can learn and work maintains fairness for all students and staff while allowing visible protest."
  },
  "9": {
    "Stance": "Shared governance and early engagement with stakeholders.",
    "Reason": "Co-develop policies with student governments, faculty senates, and staff councils. Inclusive decision-making builds legitimacy, improves compliance, and surfaces solutions (e.g., alternative venues, safety protocols) before conflicts escalate."
  },
  "10": {
    "Stance": "Legal compliance tailored to institution type, with clear commitments to free expression.",
    "Reason": "Public universities must follow First Amendment forum rules; private universities should adopt and honor clear free-expression standards. Predictable rules reduce litigation risk and political pressure while guiding consistent responses."
